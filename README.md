Project: iBook webapp

Requirements: The iBook web app is to help students to sell and buy books at a cheap price. Studnts can sell their used books on this web app.

Vision statement: 
The iBook is an online bookshop committed to offering affordable, gently used paperback textbooks for students who participate in University programs on a national scale.  iBookâ€™s e-commerce platform targets to digitize bookstore processes and enhance the customer experience through speed and convenience. Unlike Amazon, we enable customers to create a community of their own University which speeds up the ordering process. iBook is passionate about its mission of transforming bookstore services into online services through innovation.

Suitable users for this web app:
Erin is a college student who goes to a community college. She is 20 years old. She lives in a small town. Her parents are very poor. They cannot afford her education. She works very hard to afford her education. She wants to be a software engineer. She wants to help her parents. She works in a restaurant as a cashier to pay for her college tuition. She does not have so much money to pay for the textbooks. She does not like textbooks which costs more than $100. She likes to buy used books which do not cost so much. She gets frustrated sometimes when her teachers assign her expensive books for the class. 

Scenarios in which a user can use this app:
Evan is a senior undergraduate student at San Jose State University, majoring in computer science. He has finished all graduate requirements and is looking forward to graduating at the end of May. He decides to sell all his textbooks from the past for some cash to pay his student loan.
    As part of this, Evan finds over twenty old textbooks from the bookshelf, cleans the cover, removes any bookmarks, and takes a photo. He creates an account on the iBook platform and follows the instruction to sell a book by entering the name, ISBN, and subject. However, when a buyer places an order, Evan needs to mail his textbook on his own with the iBook platform's information. Evan searches online for the nearest mail service. Google Map suggests that there are few UPS and FedEx stores within 5 miles of his address. As mail services are not integrated with the iBook platform, he manages to mail his book through UPS.
